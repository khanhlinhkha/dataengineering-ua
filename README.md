# Crimes in Chicago – Data Engineering Project

This repository contains the implementation of a full data engineering pipeline for the dataset **"Crimes in Chicago"**, developed as part of the **Data Engineering (2023–2024)** course at the **University of Antwerp**.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to explore, transform, and model a large real-world dataset using key data engineering techniques. We selected the *Crimes in Chicago* dataset from Kaggle, which contains over 6 million records of reported crimes in Chicago from 2001 to 2017.

The project includes:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Supervised machine learning
- Visualizations and feature interpretation

## Repository Contents

- `1-Exploratory.py` – Exploratory data analysis.
- `2-PreprocessingforML.py` – Data cleaning, transformation, and preparation for modeling.
- `3-MachineLearning.py` – Training and evaluating multiple models on selected tasks.
- `4-FactorizedSetXGB&CAT.py` – Using XGBoost and CatBoost on a factorized feature set.
- `Data Engineering_Project_Group 3.pdf` – Final report summarizing all steps taken.

## Key Insights

- Created time-based features to understand crime patterns across day-parts and seasons.
- Aggregated and visualized crime trends by type and district.
- Developed classification models to predict the likely crime type based on contextual features.
